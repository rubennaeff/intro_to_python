# Python Exercises

## Python


### Start python

Start the python interpreter by typing `python` on the command line:

```sh
python
```

You'll see the following output:

```sh
Python 2.7.10 (default, Jun 10 2015, 19:42:47)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.1.0 (clang-602.0.53)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

You're in!

You can always quit by typing `exit()` or hitting `Ctrl-D`.


### Calculator

Using the python interpreter, compute the following:
- 123 + 321
- 1 + 2 * 3 - 4
- What is 3 divided by 5? (Note: in Python 3, try out `/` and `//`)
- What is 2 to the power 4? (Hint: `**`)


### Strings

- Make two strings: assign your first name to a variable called `first_name` and your last name to `last_name`.
- Create a list called `names` containing both of the strings above.
- What does `len(example[1])` represent?
- Make a new string called `full_name` containing your full name, using the variables `first_name` and `last_name`.
- What does `full_name.split()` do?
- (*) Create the same string `full_name` directly from the list `names`, using the string method `.join()`.





### Typing

- Find out the types of the following constants: `8`, `8.`, `"Python"`, `'c'`, `True`, `[1, 2, "three"]`, `{1: 10, 2:20}`, `{1, 2}`, `None`.
- Try to convert the above constants to string using `str()`.
- Try to convert the above constants to string using `str()`.



## Scripting

- Create a file `happiness.py` that contains a function that will print something sweet.
- Create another file `be_sweet_to_me.py` that imports and calls the above function each time it is run from the command line, using ```python be_sweet_to_me.py```.
- If you haven't done already, make sure both files have doc strings, and place comments where you think it will help.
- (*) Add the line `#!/usr/bin/env python` on top of `be_sweet_to_me.py`, and change the execution permissions using `chmod 750 be_sweet_to_me.py`. Now you should be able to run your file by typing `./be_sweet_to_me.py`.
